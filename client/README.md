## Streams app boilerplate

This project is a boilerplate project for a streaming app that can be used in many other purposes.
App built on Stephen Grider's React course.

In order to run this app you need to use a client id of google auth2 api from your google developer account (in components/GoogleAuth.js file).
Then you need to create a json file in "api-server" folder named "db.json".

To run the app you need to install the npm modules for both "api-server" and "client". (npm install)
Then run the api-server with "npm start", then run the client app in the same way.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is using React-Redux library and Redux-Thunk middleware. Also, is using Axios for HTTP requests and React-Router for routing.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
